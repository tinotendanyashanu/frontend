        content: `## What Is the Leo Systems Partner Network?

The Leo Systems Partner Network is a structured collaboration model designed for professionals to monetize their network by introducing high-value digital infrastructure projects.

This program goes beyond a standard affiliate system. It is a professional ecosystem built on:

*   **Enterprise-grade systems**: We use top-tier technology stacks and infrastructure.
*   **Structured deal tracking**: Every lead you register is tracked transparently from inception to close.
*   **Transparent commission calculation**: No hidden fees or ambiguous terms.
*   **Long-term recurring revenue**: Opportunities for ongoing earnings through maintenance and support contracts.

### Your Role vs. Our Role

**Your Role:**
Your primary objective is to identify businesses and individuals who have a genuine need for intelligent digital systems. You act as the bridge, connecting problems with our solutions. You are not expected to be a technical expert or a project manager.

**Our Role:**
We handle the heavy lifting. Once a deal is registered and approved, our team takes over to:
*   Conduct technical discovery and scoping.
*   Architect the solution.
*   Develop and deploy the system.
*   Provide ongoing support and maintenance.

By clearly defining these roles, we ensure you can focus on what you do best—networking and business development—while we deliver world-class technical execution.`,

        title: "Module 1 - Lesson 2: How Commission Works",
        slug: "how-commission-works",
        content: `## How Commission Works

Understanding your earnings is crucial. At Leo Systems, we prioritize transparency in our commission structure.

### The Calculation Formula

Your commission is straightforward and calculated based on the **final deal value**—the actual amount the client pays for the project.

**Formula:**
\`\`\`
Commission = Final Project Value × Assigned Commission Rate
\`\`\`

*   **Final Project Value**: The total contract value signed by the client (excluding taxes).
*   **Assigned Commission Rate**: The percentage determined by your partner tier.

### Variables Affecting Your Rate

Your specific commission rate is dynamic and can vary based on:

1.  **Your Partner Tier**: Higher tiers (Agency, Enterprise) command higher base rates.
2.  **Your Involvement**: Are you simply referring a lead (Referral) or actively helping to close the deal (Closing)? Active involvement often yields a higher percentage.
3.  **Deal Complexity**: exceptionally large or complex enterprise deals may have custom commission structures negotiated upfront.

### Triggering the Commission

Commission payments are not automatic upon registration. They are triggered only when the following conditions are met:

1.  **Deal is Closed**: The client has signed the contract.
2.  **Payment is Received**: The client has paid the initial invoice or the project fee.
3.  **Commission Status is Approved**: Our finance team has verified the transaction.

This ensures a fair and sustainable model for all parties.`,

      {
        title: "Module 1 - Lesson 3: Deal Lifecycle Explained",
        slug: "deal-lifecycle",
        content: `## Deal Lifecycle Explained

Every opportunity you bring to Leo Systems follows a structured lifecycle. Understanding this process ensures you know exactly where your deals stand at any moment.

### The 7 Stages of a Deal

1.  **Registered**: You submit the deal through the dashboard. It enters our system and is timestamped to protect your lead.
2.  **Under Review**: Our partnership team reviews the submission to ensure it meets our criteria (valid business, budget potential, not a duplicate).
3.  **Approved**: The deal is accepted into our pipeline. Our sales team is assigned to reach out to the prospect.
4.  **Closed**: Success! The client has signed the contract.
5.  **Payment Received**: funds have cleared in our bank account.
6.  **Commission Calculated**: The finance team calculates your final payout based on the actual received amount.
7.  **Commission Paid**: The funds are transferred to your account.

### Why Registration Matters

Stage 1 is the most critical for you. You **must** register all deals inside the dashboard immediately. This "locks in" the lead under your name, protecting your commission rights even if another partner speaks to them later.`,

        title: "Module 1 - Lesson 4: How to Register a Deal",
        slug: "how-to-register-deal",
        content: `## How to Register a Deal

Registering a deal is a simple but vital process. Follow this step-by-step guide to ensure your leads are tracked correctly.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Navigate to the Deals Tab**: Log in to your Partner Dashboard and click on "Deals" in the sidebar.
2.  **Click "Register New Deal"**: Look for the primary action button, usually at the top right.
3.  **Enter Client Name**: Provide the full legal name of the business or contact person. Accuracy here prevents duplicate disputes.
4.  **Enter Estimated Value**: Give your best guess of the project's budget. This helps us prioritize, but your commission will be based on the *final* actual value.
5.  **Select Service Category**: Choose the most relevant service (e.g., SME, Startup, Enterprise).
6.  **Add Notes**: Context is king. Add details about the client's pain points, urgency, and your relationship to them.

### What Happens After Submission?

*   **Admin Review**: A partner manager reviews the details.
*   **Notification**: You will receive an email and dashboard notification once the status changes to "Approved" or "Rejected".
*   **Protection**: Once registered, the client is "protected" for you for 90 days, meaning no other partner can claim commission on them.

*(Note: Screenshots of the registration form and status indicators would typically appear here in the visual course materials to guide you.)*`,

        title: "Module 1 - Lesson 5: Understanding Payouts",
        slug: "understanding-payouts",
        content: `## Understanding Payouts

We believe in predictable and transparent compensation.

### Tracking Your Money

Your dashboard provides a real-time financial overview:

*   **Total Earned**: The cumulative gross commission you have generated since joining.
*   **Pending Commission**: Money that has been earned (deal closed & paid) but is currently in the processing window (e.g., Net-30 or bi-weekly cycles).
*   **Paid Commission**: Funds that have successfully been transferred to your connected bank account or wallet.
*   **Payout History**: A detailed ledger of every transaction, date, and reference number.

### Payout Cycles

Payouts are processed in structured cycles (typically monthly or bi-weekly, depending on your agreement). This ensures:
*   Accuracy in accounting.
*   Verification of client funds clearing (to prevent clawbacks).
*   Predictability for your own cash flow planning.

There are no hidden calculations or "black box" metrics. What you see on your dashboard matches what hits your bank account.`,

Not every prospect is a good lead. Time is your most valuable asset. Spend it on **Qualified Leads**.

### Ideal Client Characteristics

*   **Revenue-Generating Businesses**: Companies making money can afford to pay for solutions. Avoid "pre-revenue" ideas unless they have investment.
*   **Growth-Focused Leadership**: Look for owners who use words like "scale," "invest," "grow," and "modernize."
*   **Operational Bottlenecks**: Companies experiencing "growing pains" (can't keep up with orders, support is overwhelmed) are prime candidates for automation.
*   **Budget Capacity**: They don't need millions, but they must have a budget for professional services.

### Red Flags to Avoid

*   **Extremely Early-Stage**: "I have an idea for the next Facebook but no money."
*   **"Just Curious" Inquiries**: People who want "free advice" or "just a quote" with no intent to buy.
*   **Micromanagers**: Clients who want to control every pixel usually drain profitability.`,

The quality of your answers depends on the quality of your questions. Use this structured approach to uncover pain points.

### The Toolkit

*   **"What systems are currently manual?"**
    *   *Goal*: Identify automation opportunities.
*   **"How do you track internal performance?"**
    *   *Goal*: Identify a need for dashboards or reporting tools.
*   **"What slows down your team the most?"**
    *   *Goal*: Find the bottleneck we can solve with software.
*   **"Are you planning to scale or hire soon?"**
    *   *Goal*: Position our systems as a cheaper/better alternative to hiring more administrative staff.

Discovery is about *listening*. Ask the question, then stop talking. Let them tell you where it hurts.`,

Objections are not "No." They are "I need more information/trust."

### Common Objections

**1. "It's too expensive."**
*   *Response*: "Price is what you pay. Value is what you get. Compared to the cost of manual inefficiencies—lost leads, wasted hours, errors—what is the long-term cost of *not* fixing this? Our solutions typically pay for themselves within 6-12 months."

**2. "We can do this in-house."**
*   *Response*: "You absolutely could. But do you want your best people distracted by building internal tools, or focused on your core business? We let you focus on what you do best, while we deploy best-in-class infrastructure."

**3. "Now isn't the right time."**
*   *Response*: "I understand. When do you foresee having the bandwidth to address [Specific Pain Point]? Because that problem isn't going away—it's likely costing you money every day."`,

Closing isn't magic. It's a sequence of logical steps.

### The 5-Step Process

1.  **Identify Need**: Confirm a clear pain point exists.
2.  **Confirm Budget Alignment**: "We typically work with budgets between $X and $Y. Does that sound aligned with your expectations?" (Do this early!)
3.  **Introduce Leo Systems**: "Based on what you've said, Leo Systems has a solution that fits perfectly..."
4.  **Register Deal in Dashboard**: Secure your commission rights immediately.
5.  **Coordinate Call**: "I'm going to introduce you to our technical director. When are you free for a 15-minute discovery chat?"

Don't overcomplicate it. Identify, Qualify, Register, Handoff.`,

The biggest commissions come from repeat clients. The "Hunter" lands the deal; the "Farmer" grows the account. Be both.

*   **Check in quarterly**: "How is the system running? Any new challenges?"
*   **Be a resource, not just a salesperson**: Send them news articles relevant to their industry.
*   **Protect Deal Ownership**: By staying in touch, you ensure that when they need Phase 2, they call *you*, and you register the new deal.

### Enterprise Positioning

Move from "Vendor" to "Partner."
*   Vendors sell things.
*   Partners solve business problems.

Adopting a specialized niche (e.g., "Digital Transformation for Logistics Companies") can make you the go-to expert in that field, allowing you to command higher respect and higher commissions.`,
